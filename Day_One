#### Introduction to Cybersecurity
This class is an introduction to the basics of cybersecurity.
You will learn about the main teams in cybersecurity, common types of cyber threats, and what hacking means.
*Red Team – The Simulated Attackers
These are the people who pretend to be hackers. Their job is to try breaking into systems — but not to harm anything. They do this to find weaknesses so that the system can be made stronger.
*Blue Team – The Defenders
The Blue Team is all about protection. They defend computers and networks from real attacks using tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and security monitoring systems.
*Purple Team – The Bridge Between
The Purple Team is a combination of Red and Blue. They help the two teams work better together by sharing information and strategies. This teamwork helps improve the overall safety of systems.

 **Types of Cyber Threats – What Can Go Wrong?
Cyber threats are problems or attacks that can happen online. Here are some of the most common ones you should know:
*Phishing
Trick emails or messages that try to steal personal info, like passwords or credit card numbers.
*Ransomware
A virus that locks your files and asks for money (a ransom) to unlock them.
*Malware
Short for "malicious software." This includes viruses, spyware, or anything harmful that damages systems or steals data.
*Social Engineering
Instead of attacking computers, attackers trick people into giving away private information.
*Man-in-the-Middle Attack
A sneaky method where the attacker secretly listens to or changes communication between two parties.
*Zero-Day Attack
A super dangerous attack that targets a new software flaw before anyone knows about it or can fix it.

**3️ Hacking – The Good, the Bad, and the Gray
Hacking is when someone accesses a system or data without permission. But not all hackers are the same:
*White Hat Hackers: The good guys. They use hacking to test and fix systems legally.
*Black Hat Hackers: The bad guys. They break in to steal or cause harm.
*Gray Hat Hackers: Somewhere in between. They might break rules but don’t mean to cause trouble.
